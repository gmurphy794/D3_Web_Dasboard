# D3 Web_Dashboard
In this repository I used javascript, d3.js, and Plotly.js to build an interactive dashboard using the [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) in the file app.js.  The code in the other files was already provided.

I used ploty.js to build interavtice charts includeing a PIE chart and a bubble chart, each pulling data samples from a Flask server, and updating when a new sample is selected.
